# Location-Local-Differential-Privacy

**Overview**
This code is related to the paper L-SRR: Local Differential Privacy for Location-Based Services with Staircase Randomized Response.(CCS 2022)

**Usage**

In this code, it includes the group optimization, perturbation of SRR and estimation method of SRR (in the file of SRR.py and python SRR.py).
Then you can use these three functions to get the estimated distribution of locations and use the estimated location distribution for any downstream analysis.
